## about

Heyyy, I am Pranamya G Kulal. I am mostly living in the last book I read, the last song I heard or the last movie I watched and mostly thinking about some cool project that I can develop.

I love to code. My bachelor’s studies were a time of exploration, where I chose breadth over early specialization to understand computer science as a whole. I started off by building websites and applications, giving life to the code I write and designing graphcial elements. Overtime, I expanded my curiosity to cybersecurity, compiler design, CS fundamentals like operating systems, computer networks and parallel programming (CUDA). 

I want to write code that creates impact and contributes to the betterment of the society.

Lately, I have been enjoying exploring (also my research interests) :

* Machine Learning in Healthcare
* Applied Deep Learning
* Explainale Artificial Intelligence
* Computer Vision Applications

Apart from tech, I absolutely ADORE reading fiction. On a good day, I might pen down some poetry too. I love art in all forms. The creativity of the mortal brain, the beauty in the errors and the perfectionism growing with experience. I like to draw and paint stuff. I completed my junior grade examination in drawing (even senior grade), carnatic music and bharatnatyam. Dancing makes me feel infinite. 

I believe in world peace, kindness, upliftment and diveristy.

## academics
I am an undergraduate student at the Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, India (graduating in 2026!) pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science with Honors and a Minor Specialization in Computational Intelligence. I have a CGPA of 9.7/10 and a department rank of 4.

My univeristy has offered me research exposure, fellowship opportunity, leadership and resposibilty that I am forever grateful for! I led the graphics team at The Astronomy Club Manipal and was involved in developing their website. As the class representative, I've contributed to academic communication and resposibility. I enjoy leading team-based projects and value the diverse perspectives my teammates bring.

This spring I will be interning at Eli Lilly and Company at the intersection of technology and healthcare.
