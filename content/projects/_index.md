* ### **2025** . “One-Class Classification of M. slooffiae Fungi Images
  *Python*

  Despite having no negative samples and a very small number of positive samples, this project attempts to use machine learning to classify images of the fungus M. slooffiae. Our goal is to 
  develop a system that can determine whether a new image is an outlier or a member of the M. slooffiae class by utilizing data augmentation and one-class classification techniques, 
  specifically One-Class SVM, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoders. The project shows how to adapt contemporary machine learning techniques for biological datasets that are uncommon or 
  underrepresented.
